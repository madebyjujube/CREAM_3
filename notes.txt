Hey Juju!
Here you go <3 we will need the website to exist in both french and english. Are you going to be able to do that? Can we make a simple option to flip between french and eng? Maybe we can do www.creapresents.com/fr and www.creapresents.com/eng does that make sense? Is our regular $150 payment okay with you :)?
